# twstb64decode
Super simple code made for TWST assets extraction.

Throw all the .txt files containing the Base64 codes in "input" folder and then run this in Command Line:

```py main.py```

# Notes
Make sure there's no other file inside input folder aside from .txt files.

This code assumes the result image is PNG.
